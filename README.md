- 👋 Hi, my name is Amin AISSOUS and I’m a software engineer
- 👀 I specialize in the field of API management software engineering. I have helped many organizations implement APIs by designing and building services and systems that integrate with their existing information systems workflows 
- 🌱 I am currently API leader architect at the digital factory of totalEnerrgies
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on API topics to help TDF better manage their API lifecycle
- 📫 You can reach on amin.aissous@totalenergies.com or Teams ;) 

**Using software to solve interesting problems is one of the fascinating things I really enjoy. Feel free to contact me on my email or via teams channels to ask API questions or share interesting problems. I would love to hear it!**
